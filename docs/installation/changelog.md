# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2025-02-13)

This is a massive release that includes many new features, fixes, and changes.
You can read more about the changes in the [migration guide](migration.md).

### Added

* Fast, massively parallel code execution with [SWE-ReX](https://github.com/swe-agent/SWE-ReX).
* Run SWE-agent locally but execute code in the cloud (using modal, AWS, or anything else that runs [SWE-ReX](https://github.com/swe-agent/SWE-ReX)).
* Configurable retry mechanisms: Try multiple agent configurations, models, parameters, etc., then choose the best one.
* Flexible tool definitions with [tool bundles](../config/tools.md).
* All language models supported using `litellm` (see [models](../installation/keys.md)).
* Override any configuration option from the command line (see [command line basics](../usage/cl_tutorial.md)).
* New [command line trajectory inspector](../usage/inspector.md) to scroll few hundreds of trajectories with ease.
* [New command line interface](../usage/cli.md) with subcommands for running over single issues, batches, and various utility commands.
* Greatly simplified and cleaned up codebase. In particular, the `Agent` class is now much easier to modify.

## Changed

* The code base has been largely rewritten. Lots of things have moved and changed.
* The biggest change is that we now use [SWE-ReX](https://github.com/swe-agent/SWE-ReX) for code execution. This allowed us to remove a lot of distracting code from the agent.
* We now use [`pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for all configuration.
* Templates are now [`jinja2`](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templates, which gives you more flexibility (but you'll have to update your templates)
* All models are now configured using `litellm` (see [models](../installation/keys.md)).

See the [migration guide](migration.md) for more details.

This is (mostly) a patch release, in particular fixing several issues that had been introduced by the speed improvements of v0.6.0.
We also solve a bug where existing linter errors in a file left SWE-agent unable to edit (because of our lint-retry-loop).

## 0.6.0 (2024-06-05)

[All new commits](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0)

**We sped up SWE-agent by 2x** (timed with GPT4o). This is mostly due to faster communication with the running processes inside of the Docker container and other container setup & installation related improvements. Here are a few relevant PRs:

* Switch to fast communicate and shallow clone by default by [@klieret](https://github.com/klieret) in [#530]([#530]([#530]([#530](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent/pull/530))))

## 0.5.0 (2024-05-28)

[All new commits](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0)

✨ The big news is our [brand new documentation](https://swe-agent.com/latest/) ✨

Secondly, [@ollmer](https://github.com/ollmer) added a new flag `--cache_task_images` that will significantly speed up SWE-agent when running on the same environment/repository multiple times (no more waiting for cloning and installation!)

### Breaking changes

* We have reformatted our codebase. If you create a PR based on a previous commit, make sure you install our `pre-commit` hook to avoid merge-conflicts because of formatting. See [our docs](https://swe-agent.com/latest/dev/formatting_conflicts/) for more information.
* Remove direct imports in `__init__.py` (you can no longer `from sweagent import Agent` by [@klieret](https://github.com/klieret) in [#436]([#436]([#436]([#436](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent/pull/436))))
